This is a starter project that defines a controller with an initial set of endpoints and a simple data model.  It also defines a small set of template pages.  
One of the pages contains thymeleaf code that displays data in a table.   Other pages contain a title only.   The next step is to add thymeleaf code to display a list of courses, 
and a form that allows a user to submit information to the controller.
